# 🎭 Task 06 — Deep Fake Interview

## 📌 Overview
This project builds on the narrative created in **Task 05** and transforms it into an **AI-generated “deep fake” street interview**.  
The goal was to simulate a casual interview where cricket data insights from Task 05 are presented in an engaging, conversational style.

The focus of this task is **not only the final audio/video** but also the **process**: how the script was developed, tools were tested, and the workflow was structured.

## 🛠️ Workflow

### 1. Script Creation
- A street interview–style script was written using insights from the cricket batting dataset analyzed in Task 05.
- The script highlights:
  - Top 5 run scorers  
  - Highest strike rate (Marcus Stoinis, 327+)  
  - Most sixes (RR Rossouw) and most fours (GD Phillips)  
  - Average runs per player (~16)  
  - Coaching recommendations (balance between big hitting and consistency)  
  - STEM skills gained during analysis  

### 2. Tool Exploration
Free or student resources tested included:
- **Audio**:
  - ElevenLabs free tier (text-to-speech)  
  - Audacity (voice recording and editing)  
- **Video (Deep Fake Avatars)**:
  - D-ID (AI avatars with free trial)  
  - HeyGen (short avatar-based clips)  
  - Synthesia (student plan where available)  

### 3. Output
- Generated either as:
  - **Audio (MP3)** — easiest and free option  
  - **Video (MP4)** — using free trials of avatar generators  
- If video hosting was needed, Google Drive/YouTube links were included.

## 📚 Skills Developed
- **Data Science & Statistics**: Interpreting cricket data with Python (Task 05)  
- **STEM Communication**: Turning numerical results into a natural conversation  
- **Prompt Engineering**: Designing interview-style prompts for AI models  
- **AI Tools**: Testing TTS (text-to-speech) and deep fake avatar software  
- **Documentation**: Capturing workflow, tools tested, and reflections

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open `script.txt` to view or edit the interview transcript.  
2. Feed the script into any free **text-to-speech** or **deep fake avatar** generator.  
3. Save the output in the `outputs/` folder (audio/video).  
4. Update `process.md` with your workflow notes and reflections.

## 📌 Notes
- Audio-only submissions are acceptable if video tools are limited.  
- The emphasis is on the **process** — experimentation and reflection matter more than a polished video.
